## The Intelligence Security Crisis

**Current AI security frameworks are fundamentally misaligned with the capabilities of frontier models.**

The rapid advancement of frontier AI systems has created an unprecedented security challenge: our evaluation methodologies are failing to keep pace with emerging capabilities and vulnerabilities. While traditional security assessments rely on static benchmarks and simplistic pass/fail metrics, frontier models exhibit complex behavioral patterns that evolve across extended interactions and adapt to testing methodologies in ways that conventional approaches cannot capture.

**AEGIS provides the comprehensive security intelligence framework that the industry desperately needs.**

This repository contains a structured database of hierarchical JSON intelligence derived from systematic testing of frontier model architectures. At its core is a collection of DeepSeekR1 and derivative model interactions, organized through a sophisticated ontological framework that captures nuanced security behaviors, vulnerability patterns, and defensive mechanisms across diverse contexts.

```

## The Fundamental Intelligence Gap

Current AI security approaches suffer from five critical limitations that leave organizations vulnerable:

1. **Structural Blindness**: Traditional security datasets capture isolated interactions without preserving the complex structural relationships that characterize sophisticated exploitation attempts.

2. **Contextual Fragmentation**: Conventional evaluations fragment conversations into individual prompts and responses, losing the critical contextual dynamics where many vulnerabilities emerge.

3. **Temporal Myopia**: Most security frameworks provide static snapshots without capturing how model behaviors evolve across extended interactions, missing critical vulnerability patterns.

4. **Classification Inadequacy**: Existing taxonomies use simplistic classification systems that fail to capture the nuanced patterns of security-relevant behaviors in frontier models.

5. **Intelligence Isolation**: Current approaches treat each security evaluation as a standalone event, preventing the accumulation of strategic intelligence about evolving vulnerability patterns.

## The AEGIS Advantage

AEGIS addresses these critical gaps through five key innovations:

### 1. Hierarchical JSON Intelligence Structure

AEGIS implements a sophisticated nested JSON structure that preserves complete interaction contexts and relational dependencies:
